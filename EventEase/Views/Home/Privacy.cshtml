<p>
    The company is committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of employee personal data. We collect, store, and process employee information only to the extent necessary for business operations and compliance with legal requirements.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Personal information about employees shall only be retained if it is essential for the operation of the business.</li>
    <li>Access to employees' personal data is strictly limited to authorized staff who require it for their professional duties.</li>
    <li>No employee personal data shall be shared internally without proper authorization.</li>
    <li>No employee personal data shall be disclosed to external parties without the employee’s explicit consent, except where legally mandated.</li>
    <li>The company does not monitor or involve itself in employees’ activities outside of working hours unless such activities directly impact the company’s reputation or the employee’s ability to perform their role effectively. For instance, an employee in a financial management role may be subject to review if convicted of fraud or other offences involving dishonesty.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We are dedicated to upholding these principles and ensuring that employee data is handled with the highest standards of privacy and security.
